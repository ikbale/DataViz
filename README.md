## What is a Gantt Chart?

Before getting into it, let's start with some history!

Gantt was first introduced in the 1910's by **Henry Gantt**. It is a graphical representation of the progression of time against the duration of tasks and is mainly used in project management to help with its organization, scheduling and tracking. The reason why it is still currently used is because it is visual and keep tasks organized over time.

So basically, a Gantt chart is a bar graph that illustrates a project's schedule, including the start and finish dates of project segments.

that's what a basic Gantt chart looks like:

## Historical examples of Gantt Chart

####1. The Hoover Dam

Infrastructure is one of the first fields that utilized the *Gantt Chart*. The **Hoover Dam** is a 
remarquable example of a *Gantt* success story because by using this technique, the project was finished *two* years ahead.  
here is the original representation of the diagram :
![Hoover-Dam-Gantt](http://https://github.com/ikbale/DataViz/tree/master#dataviz/img/Hoover-Dam-Gantt.jpg)


> the Hoover Dam is a dam on the border between the two of U.S. states: Nevada and Arizona.

####2. WW1 Navy

## Critics

###1. Advantages
As shown above, The gantt chart is a simple grid formed by a series of horizontal and vertical lines.It is mainly divided in two sections; One contains the different tasks schedule, durations ... and the other section represents graphically the duration of each task according to a unit measurement (days, weeks, months). A good one must contain these informations: 

* The name of the task.
* The duration of the task.
* Task dependencies.
* Names of resources needed to complete the task.

###2. Variations
Multiple charts are used along with the Gantt chart, the most popular combinationis:

###### 1. Milestone chart : 
This type of charts is used to show only the most important steps of the project. So when combined with the Gantt chart, it gives the result shown below:

![milestones](http://https://github.com/ikbale/DataViz/tree/master#dataviz/img/milestones.png)

> Important milestones are shown with a single diamond symbol.

###3. Limitations
Here are some Gantt chart limitations:

###### 1. size of bar doesn't reflect the work load:
The charts indicates only the time and the period of the task but not its complexity.

###### 2. charts are not agile :
They need to be updated constantly so the process of changing the charts should be convenient.


## Conclusion

I think with the importance raised over project management methods, the Gantt chart can be fused with several ones like **Agile** methods. we can finish by a simple illustration of this fusion:

We can see that tasks are grouped by sprints as known in Agile methods as **Scrum**.For further informations on the Scrum method, visit the link below:
